## Herder

__A roommate searching app that ranks possible roommates by how closely they match the questions you answer.__

Herder is very much in beta, things will break! When they do, please please please let me know. Contact details can be found on the website.

If you are an incoming or current WPI student, check the Announcement channel on the WPI Class of 2025 Discord server.

## How to use

1. Login with Discord
2. Go to Profile, and select Edit Profile. Then fill in as many questions as possible and press save changes.
3. Go to Search, select what kind of roommate you are looking for and click Search.
4. That's it! ðŸ“ˆ Now you can see the percentage of how closely you match with other people. You can find a person's discord username and digits on their profile card so you can reach out.
